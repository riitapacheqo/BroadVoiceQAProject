1. What questions would you ask in order to clarify requirements?
2. Specify 5 test cases to test this requirement



1.
How will the error messages be when the user doesn't fill all the mandatory fields?

In the user creation image, we see that the email is not a mandatory field. Will it be possible to create the new user without email?

In the 4th point we see that the email address, the first and last name will be displayed on the home page after the log in, but in the image provided we don't see the email and see other options. Will the email address also be present in the home page as specified?

At last, what time will the user have to change is password? (to understand how much time should the temporary password last)
